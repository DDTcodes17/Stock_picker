# StockPicker Crew

This is the StockPicker Crew project, powered by [crewAI]. This template is designed to help set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. The goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Understanding The Crew

The stock_picker Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
